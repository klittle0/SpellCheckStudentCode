| Sep 24 |  8:45-9:30am  |                                                                                              I considered multiple ways to approach the problem. The first thing I thought about was using a tree in the same way that we used it on the quiz, basically with the root representing a prefix, each node representing a word, and each edge representing the addition of more letters to that word. I think this would be a good strategy to organize the dictionary so that I don't have to check every word in the text against every word in the dictionary. |
| Sep 24 |  5:00-5:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I continued thinking about different ways to solve the problem efficiently. I decided to start by traversing through the text and condensing it into an array of one instance of all the words that appear. This will reduce the # of checks I have to perform. I also started thinking about the big O of my ideated solution. |
| Sep 25 |  2:00-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  With Lilliana and Sierra, I drew out a tree to represent this solution and worked on some pseudocode. I began converting some of the pseudocode to real code. |
| Sep 25 |  3:30-4:00pm  |                                                                                                 I continued converting the pseudocode to code and quickly realized that maybe this method wasn't super efficient. As I was coding, I discovered several instances where I would need to use nested for loops and/or while loops that I hadn't previously considered. I think the way that I'm using an array to track the nodes of each word in the dictionary is causing a lot of inefficiency. Maybe I could find a different data structure than an array?? |

I added the necessary methods & instance variables. |
| Oct 3  | 9:00-10:00am  |                                                                                                                                                                         I continued working on the Trie class. To me, a recursive approach made the most sense for searching and insertion, so I began writing my base cases & recursive steps. At the end, I was running into indexing errors, so I need to go back & look through how I'm checking the length of the string against the depth, because that's the only place I could be going out of bounds. |
| Oct 6  |  4:00-4:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I fixed my indexing errors—I was correct to suspect the problem was in the way I was checking string length against depth—and finalized my Trie class. I wrote the code in my spellcheck method, creating one Trie for my dictionary and one Trie for my misspelled words. |
| Oct 6  |  4:30-5:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The first sentence check worked, but the second check on the Jaberwocky poem failed. For some reason, I'm returning a list of 37 words, when it should be 24. I am getting repeats, so I think either my lookup or insert method isn't correct. I double-checked my logic in the spellcheck method, and I think that is working properly. |
| Oct 6  |  5:00-6:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                    I added a bunch of print statements throughout my code, as well as a String variable that tracks the current word being searched for/inserted, character by character. Still, I can't figure out why I'm adding repeats to my list. My insert method seems to be working properly, since I was able to add & print out the entire dictionary correctly. Now I will check the lookup method more thoroughly. |
| Oct 6  |  6:00-7:00pm  | To the lookup method, I added a String variable that tracks the current word being searched for, character by character. This way, when I reach my second base case, I can print out the word that I have identified in my code, then compare that to the word that I'm actually searching for. I tried the Jaberwocky test again, and it seems like words aren't properly being inserted into the misspelled tree mid-way through the poem. For example, my code doesn't register that it has already seen Jaberwocky, so it adds it 3 times to "misspelled". |
| Oct 6  |  7:30-8:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I checked to see if I was setting the end of the word to "true" properly, since that seems like it could cause my error, and I continued modifying my mid-code print statements to see if I could figure anything out. I wasn't able to, so I'm going to meet with Mr. Blick tomorrow during tutorial. |

I spent a lot of time thinking about the three possible paths for recursion, specifically how the left/right paths won't increment depth, since technically the current level of nodes is skipped in the lookup. |

I am getting an error about indexing and accessing null values. I think I need to add an if statement that checks whether the current node is null before performing any of the other checks. |

I had accidentally checked whether a word was in the dictionary twice, instead of checking both the dictionary and misspelled Trie. I also fixed a couple minor bugs in my TST class and improved documentation and abstraction across all of my classes. I also added helper methods for my lookup & insert methods. |
