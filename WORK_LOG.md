| Sep 24 | 8:45-9:30am  | I considered multiple ways to approach the problem. The first thing I thought about was using a tree in the same way that we used it on the quiz, basically with the root representing a prefix, each node representing a word, and each edge representing the addition of more letters to that word. I think this would be a good strategy to organize the dictionary so that I don't have to check every word in the text against every word in the dictionary. |

I decided to start by traversing through the text and condensing it into an array of one instance of all the words that appear. This will reduce the # of checks I have to perform. I also started thinking about the big O of my ideated solution. |

I began converting some of the pseudocode to real code. |
| Sep 25 | 3:30-4:00pm  |    I continued converting the pseudocode to code and quickly realized that maybe this method wasn't super efficient. As I was coding, I discovered several instances where I would need to use nested for loops and/or while loops that I hadn't previously considered. I think the way that I'm using an array to track the nodes of each word in the dictionary is causing a lot of inefficiency. Maybe I could find a different data structure than an array?? |
